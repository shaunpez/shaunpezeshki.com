Those were the days when every weekend was an epic rager filled with bars, clubs, casual hookups, and more bars. I was young, gay, and pretty damn cute if I may say so myself (what can I say, the mirror was very kind back then, and still is). I was just winging it without a care in the world. Back then, it wasn't about finding \"The One\" - just living for the night and those fleeting moments of thrilling debauchery with a rotating cast of reckless acquaintances. Ah youth, when forging hundreds of superficial connections felt like the epitome of life well-lived. I felt like I had my life together and I was on the right trajectory.</p>\n<div class=\"flex flex-wrap items-center\">\n  <div class=\"w-full md:w-2/3 pr-6\">\n    <h2>The 30s Quandary: Seeking Substance</h2>\n    <p>But then my 30s came around and pulled the rug right out from under me. Suddenly the hangovers hit way harder and that rat race of chasing the next party high started feeling...empty. Damn you, maturity! The pandemic didn't help either, making the world feel smaller just as I was supposed to be coming into my own. How does one break out of their shell again when real human interaction sans screens feels so foreign?</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"w-full md:w-1/3\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 1500px; \">\n      <a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/8180642bbabbf3317eff8d9e8217145b/c58a3/find-substance-v2.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 133.25%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"Shaun at the Eiffel Tower\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/8180642bbabbf3317eff8d9e8217145b/c58a3/find-substance-v2.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/8180642bbabbf3317eff8d9e8217145b/066f9/find-substance-v2.jpg 400w,\n/static/8180642bbabbf3317eff8d9e8217145b/4b190/find-substance-v2.jpg 800w,\n/static/8180642bbabbf3317eff8d9e8217145b/c58a3/find-substance-v2.jpg 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n  </a>\n    </span>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<h2>The Cycle of Weekend Regrets</h2>\n<p>I tried to relive my glory days, but each new boozy outing increasingly felt like a mistaken return to college antics, with progressively worse morning-after shame. So I pivoted to \"calmer\" social activities, only to be overwhelmed by intense FOMO because where was the real fun?! I desperately wanted to recapture that spark, but hobbies and \"finding your passion\" felt like always being the bridesmaid, never the bride.</p>\n<h2>The Siren Call of the Endless Party</h2>\n<p>In your 30s, the gays who seem to be having the most fun are the ones still partying hard like they're in their 20s. The attractive, socially active guys going from bar to club to circuit party weekend after weekend. That's the visible idea of a \"good time\" that gets projected out there. It's honestly tempting to keep chasing that endless party, because you don't see many examples of attractive men having just as much fun at a knitting class or pottery studio. Even if they are out there, those lower-key enjoyments don't get broadcasted the same way.</p>\n<p>Finding your \"third place\" - those community spaces beyond home and work where you can forge connections - becomes even harder. When the main meeting scene is still centered around bars, it feeds into the unconscious pressure to stay in that party loop to have a social life at all. If you decide not to take that path, the alternative is feeling ostracized or antisocial.</p>\n<h2>The Pursuit of Alternative Enjoyments</h2>\n<p>Dating only compounded the confusion in this new decade. Kiss those casual bar flirtations goodbye - hello to endlessly swiping through a Black Mirror dating hellscape where everyone seems to be chasing an airbrushed Mr. Perfect. As someone mixed race, I get the added \"bonus\" of being exoticized to high heaven on these apps, or more commonly, being told I'm not attractive or just not their type.</p>\n<h2>Seeking Role Models and Redefining Fun</h2>\n<p>The queer community's social life script gets really murky in your 30s too when you don't follow the traditional path of marriage and kids. With few role models out there for successful queer guys of color who've figured out this whole \"life\" thing, it's like being a kindergartner without motivational pictures on the classroom walls. I do find some minorities who seem to have achieved fame and what looks like a balanced life from the outside. For some reason, it sparks a twinge of jealousy in me - not really at them, but a jealousy that they may have cracked the secret sauce to a fulfilling, balanced life that I'm still searching for.</p>\n<h2>Embracing the Journey, But What's the Secret?</h2>\n<p>All this adrift uncertainty has me low-key wondering if I should just say \"screw it\" and jet off to be a cabana boy on some beach. But then I'd just be that weirdo getting older while chasing a young person's dream. At the end of the day, the struggle to redefine myself and find fulfillment as a queer man of color in my 30s is real. But this messy journey is also an opportunity for self-discovery and growth - even if I haven't quite deciphered the path yet. The question remains - have others figured it out? What's the secret to navigating this decade with purpose and balance? For now, it is what it izz, bring it on!</p>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Transition from Party Animal to...Something Else?","date":"March 14, 2024","slug":"transition-from-party-animal-to-something-else","excerpt":"Transitioning from the vibrant nightlife of your 20s to a more subdued social life in your 30s can be a perplexing journey.","image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fixed","backgroundColor":"#e8a878","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/79199e4fe2923e2ef01e0f428be9be3b/d5d95/endless-party-v4.jpg","srcSet":"/static/79199e4fe2923e2ef01e0f428be9be3b/d5d95/endless-party-v4.jpg 1200w","sizes":"1200px"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/79199e4fe2923e2ef01e0f428be9be3b/17d6e/endless-party-v4.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"1200px"}]},"width":1200,"height":592}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"transition-from-party-animal-to-something-else"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","764694655"],"slicesMap":{}}

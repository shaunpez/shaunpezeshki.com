During our early days at Wayne State University, we were young and embarking on an exciting new phase of life. It was at the Honors College, where we all met and quickly formed a close-knit, diverse group. Among us was an individual who stood out with her humor and a certain mysterious aura. For the purposes of this story, let's refer to her as "DE."

## Introducing DE

DE wasn't your typical standout; she wasn't always the center of attention, but there was something about her. She had a way of mixing humor with a bit of secrecy that piqued your curiosity. Her tales were filled with little adventures and slight acts of rebellion, which were captivating, especially for a bunch of geeks at age 18 learning about what was out there. They suggested there was more to her beneath the surface. Within our diverse group, where everyone had their own stories and aspirations, DE was like a puzzle with some pieces missing. She drew you in, making you wonder about the parts of her story she wasn't telling.

## The Plot Unfolds

As the semester progressed, DE slowly shared more about her personal life, particularly about a new boyfriend in Canada. She painted a picture of him as somewhat of a rebel or "bad boy" â€” a description that, coupled with his  charm, made the narrative all the more captivating. However, our intrigue turned into concern when DE revealed her family's expectation of an arranged marriage. Despite having someone she was interested in, it seemed she had no choice in the matter. While we understood that arranged marriages are a part of Indian culture, the prospect of such a significant life event at our young age was surprising and led us to worry about DE's well-being and ability to make her own choices.

## A Leap of Faith

DE was caught between her family's traditional expectations and her own desires. She approached us with a serious request, disguised as an adventure: she needed help to cross into Canada to potentially stay her boyfriend. The plan involved leaving her car on campus, a decision to ensure the vehicle wouldn't be reported stolen or tracked. What added to the complexity was that DE didn't have her physical passport; she only had photocopies, which made the border crossing even more precarious.  Despite understanding the potential risks, including significant legal implications for our friend who would be assisting her, we decided to go through with it. Against all odds, we successfully helped her reach her "boyfriend" in Canada.

## The Unraveling

The situation shifted when DE's parents reached out to us, unaware of her whereabouts. Initially hesitant, our conversation revealed inconsistencies.

### The Discrepancies

It became clear that much of what DE had shared with us might not have been accurate. Contrary to DE's stories, her parents were completely unaware of any arranged marriage plans. Additionally, her academic achievements were not as she had portrayed them. Importantly, it was also revealed that her parents were not the tyrants DE made them out to be.

### The Consequences

This revelation raised serious concerns, especially since we had just left DE with someone whose true nature and intentions were unknown to us. The possibility that we might have unknowingly placed her in a potentially risky situation added a layer of gravity to the entire ordeal.

### The Aftermath

Eventually, DE returned home, but the fallout from her actions had profound consequences. Her family, deeply affected by the events and the shame brought upon them, made the significant decision to move back to India. This highlighted the severe impact of DE's actions not only on herself but also on her family. This experience forced us to confront the consequences of our choices and to recognize that we may not have fully grasped who DE really was or the true nature of the situation we had become involved in.

## Reflections on the Mirage

After everything settled down, we had a lot to think about. We wondered if the pressure to meet high expectations, a common experience for many from minority backgrounds, had led DE to create a version of her life that was more about escape than reality. It made us question whether her actions were a call for help or an attempt to break free from the constraints placed on her by her family and society. Additionally, we couldn't shake the possibility that DE's behavior might have been influenced by mental health struggles, as her actions seemed to defy rational explanation.

## The Takeaway

Going through this experience with DE opened our eyes to the complexity of human behavior, the importance of critical thinking, and the weight of the expectations we carry. It was a reminder that there's often more to people's stories than what they show on the surface. Moving forward, we're taking with us the importance of being empathetic and understanding, but also the need to ask questions and look beyond the surface of the stories we're told.
